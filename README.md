The goal of this project is to get more comfortable working with HTML and CSS, specifically embedding images and videos. 
This is an assignment from The Odin Project. The instructions were to build Youtube's media player page. 
This got me more comfortable with media elements and positioning with CSS. I also got a chance to get comfortable using Google Fonts and Icons.
